# FullSIX WordPress Plugin

This plugin is made to be used with [FullSIXWordPressBundle](https://github.com/fullsixspain/FullSIXWordPressBundle).

Its main purpose is to interpret Twig markup inside contents for the documents that have the "twig" tag.

Additionally it adds tags and categories support to standard pages.
